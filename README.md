# Radiance_Validation
A validation of Radiance model using the radiation values predicted with Neural network model

Since the Radiance model needs the direct and diffuse radiation to accurately simulate the light in a HDR, 
a Neural network model is used to predict these value based on the data collected from local weather station.

This repo has comparisions of the percieved illuminance from simulated images with that of the real HDR images taken in the 
living lab (Also from the Illuminance sensors).
